‚óæ **Library and Information Science**    
As a first Area of study, I am interested in **Information Behavior**  of users interacting with information systems. 

‚óæ **Psychology**    
Through my studies in Psychology, I have gained an understanding of human minds and cognition, which aids in researching **User experience (UX)**.

‚óæ **Statistics**  
To enhance data-driven research, I learned analytical technologies like **Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Big-data processing.**    

‚óæ **Data Curation** (Microdgree)  
While my education spanned Statistics and Computer engineering, my primary interest lies not in developing algorithms but in 'Data curation‚Äô - a unique approach I believe is best learned within the domain of LIS.   

=> My ultimate goal is to use these competencies **to study users‚Äô behaviors** and contribute to improving **accessibility** for marginalized groups. 

<br><br>

## <center> üñã Areas of Interest </center>

<br>  

‚ñ∂ **Information Behavior** and **User study**  

- Information behavior (search as learning, seeking model)
- User behavior on Digital libraries 
<!-- - Information behavior interacting with information systems (Generative AI, Social meida, Multimeda )    
- User Emotion Analysis -->

        

‚ñ∂ **Information for all**  

- Including Marginalized populations 
- Increasing accessibility for people with any disabilities
- Sociotechnical solutions

<br> 

‚ñ∂ **Applying Data-driven research methods**

- User Experience (UX)--Mixed methods
- Text analysis 
<!--- Scalable data processing for Big-data as on Social media-->
<!-- - Classifying and predicting user behavior through Machine learning(ML) -->
<!--- Other Statistical methods... -->

# <center> Experience <center> 
<br>
I had a lot of diverse experiences over the years, each of which led me to my current career path.

  <h3>Internship</h3>
  <justify> I worked as a business intern at Trost, a startup offering digital mental health services. <u>There, I identified a critical need: people living with mental illnesses often face significant challenges in seeking and interpreting information.</u> Recognizing these challenges, I became passionate about designing accessible information systems for those struggling with low literacy.</justify>

  <h3> Awards in Data Utilization Contest</h3>
   After learning data analysis through statistics, I participated in 6 competitions, winning awards in 3 of them. My involvement in real-world projects has sharpened <u>my skills in applying machine learning, natural language processing, and big data processing techniques to extract bright insights from raw data.</u> I plan to continue leveraging these technical skills in my future research.

  <h3> Visiting the U.S. Libraries</h3>
  <justify> During my visit to the U.S. under my school's 'Global Expedition' program, I explored various libraries. This experience revealed the community support role of American libraries, contrasting with Korea's study-focused libraries. This inspired me to transform Korean libraries by adopting the inclusive, community-engaged approach. My goal is to study user-centric systems for diverse audiences. </justify>

<justify> Over the last 2 years, participating in 20+ team activities has reinforced this for me. Embracing diverse viewpoints and leveraging each member's unique skills, I‚Äôve learned the power of collective effort in overcoming challenges and achieving shared goals, enhancing my inclusive and collaborative leadership style. </justify>

<h4> üî•  No pain No gain </h4>

<justify> After completing my term as a Vice President, I went through a bit of a slump due to concerns about my career path. At that moment, I needed to find a source of power to overcome. For this reason, I climbed Hallasan, the highest mountain in South Korea, once a week for a while. As I made my way to the top of the mountain, the cold and hunger I endured gave me a new appreciation for the value of not giving up!! I realized "I can try everything!".     
</justify>

<h4> üçÄ Where there‚Äôs a will, there‚Äôs a way.  </h4>

<justify> I believe in the value of firsthand experience for informed decision-making, so I've always prioritized gaining practical experience in my career. These values have shaped me into a go-getter person. So I may have more failures than others. Nevertheless, growth can be derived from even failed experiences. I'll continue to try hard with motivation. </justify>
