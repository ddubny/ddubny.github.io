◾ **Library and Information Science**    
As a first Area of study, I am interested in **Information Behavior** and how information behavior affects **decision-making and problem-solving.**

◾ **Psychology**    
Through my studies in Psychology, I have gained an understanding of human minds and cognition, which aids in researching **User experience (UX)**.

◾ **Statistics**  
To enhance data-driven research, I studied analytical technologies like **Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Big-data processing.**    

◾ **Data Curation** (Microdgree)  
While my education spanned Statistics and Computer engineering, my primary interest lies not in developing algorithms but in 'Data curation’ - a unique approach I believe is best learned within the domain of LIS.   

=> My ultimate goal is to use these competencies **to study users’ behaviors** and contribute to **sociotechnical solutions for user-centric information systems.** 

<br><br>

## <center> 🖋 Areas of Interest </center>

<br>  

▶ **Information Behavior**   

- Information behavior of individuals with low literacy levels ( mental illness, limited education, non-native language speakers, etc. )
- Identify information behaviors that critically impact decision-making / problem-solving 

▶ **User Experience & human-computer interaction** 

- Emotional interaction between humans and computer 
- Text based interaction between user and information systems 

▶ **Applying Machine Learnig (ML) & Natural language processing (NLP)**

- Social media analysis
- Classify and predict decision-making processes based on user behavior

   <h3>Vice-president of student council</h3>
   <justify>       
    My deep love for the major, Library and information science, came from being a part of the student government. Because I had a sense of belonging. </justify>

  <h3>Internship</h3>
  <justify> I worked as a business intern at Trost, a startup offering digital mental health services. <u>There, I identified a critical need: people living with mental illnesses often face significant challenges in seeking and interpreting information.</u> Recognizing these challenges, I became passionate about designing accessible information systems for those struggling with low literacy.</justify>

  <h3> Award in Data Utilization Contest </h3>
   After learning data analysis through statistics, I participated in 6 competitions, winning awards in 3 of them. My involvement in real-world projects has sharpened my skills in applying machine learning, natural language processing, and big data processing techniques to extract bright insights from raw data. I plan to continue leveraging these technical skills in my future research.

  <h3> Visiting the U.S. Library</h3>
  <justify> During my visit to the U.S. under my school's 'Global Expedition' program, I explored various libraries. This experience revealed the community support role of American libraries, contrasting with Korea's study-focused libraries. This inspired me to transform Korean libraries by adopting the inclusive, community-engaged approach. My goal is to study user-centric systems for diverse audiences. </justify>

  <h3> UNLV engineering workshop  </h3> 
  My latest experience, the Engineering Workshop Program at UNLV, provided me with the opportunity to strengthen my professional skills in information technology. In particular, I specialized in projects that utilized machine learning. I worked on a model development project to apply machine learning to big data via parallel processing, and I also learned image analysis and survival analysis using machine learning. <u> This experience has broadened the possibilities for me to apply various analytical methods in my research in computational social science.</u>

<justify> Over the last 2 years, participating in 20+ team activities has reinforced this for me. Embracing diverse viewpoints and leveraging each member's unique skills, I’ve learned the power of collective effort in overcoming challenges and achieving shared goals, enhancing my inclusive and collaborative leadership style. </justify>

<justify> After completing my term as a Vice President, I went through a bit of a slump due to concern of career path. In that moment, I needed to find a source of power to overcome. For this reason, I climbed Hallasan, the highest mountain in South Korea, once a week for a while. As I made my way to the top of the mountain, the cold and hunger I endured gave me a new appreciation for the value of not giving up!! I realized "I can try everything!!".     
</justify>

<h4> 🍀 Where there’s a will, there’s a way.  </h4>

<justify> I believe in the value of firsthand experience for informed decision-making, so I've always prioritized gaining practical experience in my career.These values have shaped me into a challenging person. So I may have more failures than others. Nevertheless, growth can be derived from even failed experiences. I'll try hard with motivation. </justify>
