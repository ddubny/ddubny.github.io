# <center> Areas of Interest </center>
<br>  
▶ **Information Behavior**

- Search
- Information Seeking
- Information Encountering / Serendipity  => ✨My master thesis's subject!!✨

▶ **Human-AI interaction**  

- Generative AI 
- Future Information systems / Libraries with AI

<br>
With this interdisciplinary background, I stand at the intersection of the humanities and technology (information systems). Over the next five years, I anticipate that rapid technological advances will widen disparities—not only in access to information but in everyday life—driven by uneven AI literacy and technical skills. In this context, the shaping of information systems will become even more consequential. I therefore aim to investigate information behavior as foundation for shaping these systems responsibly. Methodologically, I want to employ computational approaches—including NLP/ML analyses and experiment designs. My goal is to help move beyond a paradigm in which users must search for information, toward systems that proactively and interactively deliver trustworthy information to people when and where it is needed.

# <center> Experience <center> 
<br>
I had a lot of diverse experiences over the years, each of which led me to my current career path.

   <h3>Vice-president of student council</h3>
   <justify>       
    My deep love for the major, Library and information science, came from being a part of the student government.  </justify>

  <h3>Internship</h3>
  <justify> I worked as a business intern at Trost, a startup offering digital mental health services. <u>There, I identified a critical need: people living with mental illnesses often face significant challenges in seeking and interpreting information.</u> Recognizing these challenges, I became passionate about designing accessible information systems for those struggling with low literacy.</justify>

  <h3> Awards in Data Utilization Contest</h3>
   After learning data analysis through statistics, I participated in 6 competitions, winning awards in 3 of them. My involvement in real-world projects has sharpened <u>my skills in applying machine learning, natural language processing, and big data processing techniques to extract bright insights from raw data.</u> I plan to continue leveraging these technical skills in my future research.

  <h3> Visiting the U.S. Libraries</h3>
  <justify> During my visit to the U.S. under my school's 'Global Expedition' program, I explored various libraries. This experience revealed the community support role of American libraries, contrasting with Korea's study-focused libraries. This inspired me to transform Korean libraries by adopting the inclusive, community-engaged approach. My goal is to study user-centric systems for diverse audiences. </justify>

<justify>  I thrive on hard work, embrace ambitious projects and remain committed to learning. As I enter a PhD program, I am prepared to undergo the most challenging period of my life. I expect that technologies will change rapidly during the five years I spend pursuing the PhD. Therefore, when I step out into the world after earning my degree, I hope to take on roles that will truly be of help to society. </justify>
