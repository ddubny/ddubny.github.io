◾ **Library and Information Science**    
As a first discipline, this is how I got into information technology. In particular, I am interested in **Digital Curation** and **Computational Social Science**.   

◾ **Psychology**   
It started as a way to help a student government partner who was depressed. I currently use it to **analyze behavioral and Physiological data.**      

◾ **Statistics**  
It will help me design the research. Plus, I can use **Big-data** analytics and **Machine Learning** method.     

◾ **Data Curation**  
It is a specialized career within informatics. It's about **gathering** the data what I need, **storytelling** it, and putting it into meaningful **visualizations**.

## <center> 🖋 Study Area </center>

<br>
My interests have been broad and varied.With experience, I hope to narrow my interests to areas that I find more interesting.       

▶ **Computational Social Science**   

<div class="notice--gray">
  Within psychology, I am interested in social psychology, and I find it engaging to study the interactions between individuals and communities in various social situations. In most of study, the way to research social psychology begins with surveys. Of course, surveys allow me to identify independent variables more directly that affect the dependent variable, but they don't allow for exploratory analysis(EDA) and don't allow for getting large volumes of data. I want to leverage the information technology that I have and approach it by utilizing a variety of data.

# <center> Experience <center> 
<br>

I had a lot of diverse experiences in university, each of which led me to my current career path.

   <h3>Student Government vice-president</h3>
   <justify> <u> My deep love for the major, Library and information science, came from being a part of the student government. </u> Because I had a sense of belonging. 
   And to be able to explain the department to high school students visiting the college at the fair, I needed to know it well. As I was describing the direction of LIS and the fields it covers, I was naturally intrigued. In addition, this experience gave me the opportunity to communicate with a wide range of people. Especially, I spent a lot of time with my campaign partner. One day, my partner complained of psychological distress under the pressure. I wanted to help him, so I looked up various psychology books, and <u> that's how I got interested in psychology. </u></justify>

  <h3>Digital Mental Health Service</h3>
  <justify> When I was worried about my partner's mental health issues, I was concerned about the stigmatization of accessing psychological services in Korea. That's why I thought a digital service where people can chat with an AI chatbot to solve mild mental problems would be nice. So, I interned at a startup company that provides digital mental health services, and at the same time, I conducted a meta-analysis of words with a psychological scale for emotion words. <u> Thus, I am passionate about using sentiment analysis in natural language processing to assess the emotional level of text.</u></justify>

  <h3> Data driven society & computational social science </h3>
   As with my previous experience, I am curious about applying computational analysis methods to improve or understand social phenomenon. <u>Investigating social and behviroal interactions through social modeling and network analysis is the most interesting area.</u> In this regard, psychology is my domain knowledge and provides me with expertise in the interpretation of behavioral data. Also, by combining cognitive psychology combined with statistics, <u>I can make some pretty cool visualizations. </u>

  <h3> Visiting thethe U.S. Library</h3>
  <justify> My full-fledged interests in library began when I traveled to United states Libraries. I have visited lots of public libraries in Los Angeles, including the LA Central Library, and some university libraries like UCLA or Standford. In particular, the university libraries in US gave me a fresh shock. Compared to Korean students, American seemed to regard the library as a real source of knowledge and an active space. Especially, in the case of the UNLV library, I experienced the library as a user rather than a visitor. I was free to discuss with my team members at open spaces in the library and even allowed to eat a drink or snack. For this reason, I am interested in the US library system and culture, wondering what makes such a big difference between the library culture in Korea and America. </justify>

  <h3> UNLV engineering workshop  </h3> 
  My latest experience, the Engineering Workshop Program at UNLV, provided me with the opportunity to strengthen my professional skills in information technology. In particular, I specialized in projects that utilized machine learning. I worked on a model development project to apply machine learning to big data via parallel processing, and I also learned image analysis and survival analysis using machine learning. <u> This experience has broadened the possibilities for me to apply various analytical methods in my research in computational social science.</u>

</figure>

<justify> Last 4 years, I participated in at least 20 team activities. This has allowed me to meet a lot of different people. Some people are very motivated, but others are not. So, I feel that the qualities needed as a leader are not to try to change them, but to show them how to work with their personality and personal circumstances. The important thing is to get them involved, so the team doesn't lose out. When I get a diverse group of people involved, it takes time to put the pieces together at first, but it can lead to creative and convergent thinking. </justify>

<justify> I think it would be dangerous to make decisions about things I haven't experienced, so I've always emphasized experience when it comes to my career. These values have shaped me into a challenging person. So I may have more failures than others. Nevertheless, growth can be derived from even failed experiences. I'll definitely try hard with a motivation. </justify>
