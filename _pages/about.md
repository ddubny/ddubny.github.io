◾ **Library and Information Science**    
As a first Area of study, I am interested in **Information Behavior** and how information behavior affects **decision-making and problem-solving.**

◾ **Psychology**    
Through my studies in Psychology, I have gained an understanding of human minds and cognition, which aids in researching **User experience (UX)**.

◾ **Statistics**  
To enhance data-driven research, I studied analytical technologies like **Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Big-data processing.**    

◾ **Data Curation** (Microdgree)  
While my education spanned Statistics and Computer engineering, my primary interest lies not in developing algorithms but in 'Data curation’ - a unique approach I believe is best learned within the domain of LIS.   

=> My ultimate goal is to use these competencies **to study users’ behaviors** and contribute to **sociotechnical solutions for user-centric information systems.** 

<br><br>

## <center> 🖋 Areas of Interest </center>

<br>  

▶ **Information Behavior**   

- Information behavior of individuals with low literacy levels ( mental illness, limited education, non-native language speakers, etc. )
- Identify information behaviors that critically impact decision-making / problem-solving 

▶ **User Experience & human-computer interaction** 

- Emotional interaction between humans and computer 
- Text based interaction between user and information systems 

▶ **Applying Machine Learnig (ML) & Natural language processing (NLP)**

- Social media analysis
- Classify and predict decision-making processes based on user behavior

# <center> Experience <center> 
<br>
I had a lot of diverse experiences over the years, each of which led me to my current career path.

   <h3>Vice-president of student council</h3>

    My deep love for the major, Library and information science, came from being a part of the student government. Because I had a sense of belonging. </justify>

  <h3>Internship</h3>
  <justify> I worked as a business intern at Trost, a startup offering digital mental health services. There, I identified a critical need: people living with mental illnesses often face significant challenges in seeking and interpreting information. This is because mental health conditions can impact cognitive functions such as attention and decision-making, which are crucial for information literacy. Recognizing these challenges, I became passionate about designing accessible information systems for those struggling with low literacy. </u></justify>

  <h3> Computational social science </h3>
   As with my previous experience, I am curious about applying computational analysis methods to improve or understand social phenomenon. <u>Investigating social and behviroal interactions through social modeling and network analysis is the most interesting area.</u> In this regard, psychology is my domain knowledge and provides me with expertise in the interpretation of behavioral data. Also, by combining cognitive psychology combined with statistics, <u>I can make some pretty cool visualizations. </u>

  <h3> Visiting the U.S. Library</h3>
  <justify> My full-fledged interests in library began when I traveled to United states Libraries. I have visited lots of public libraries in Los Angeles, including the LA Central Library, and some university libraries like UCLA or Standford. In particular, the university libraries in US gave me a fresh shock. Compared to Korean students, American seemed to regard the library as a real source of knowledge and an active space. <u> For this reason, I am interested in the US library system and culture, wondering what makes such a big difference.</u> </justify>

  <h3> UNLV engineering workshop  </h3> 
  My latest experience, the Engineering Workshop Program at UNLV, provided me with the opportunity to strengthen my professional skills in information technology. In particular, I specialized in projects that utilized machine learning. I worked on a model development project to apply machine learning to big data via parallel processing, and I also learned image analysis and survival analysis using machine learning. <u> This experience has broadened the possibilities for me to apply various analytical methods in my research in computational social science.</u>

<justify> Over the last 2 years, participating in 20+ team activities has reinforced this for me. Embracing diverse viewpoints and leveraging each member's unique skills, I’ve learned the power of collective effort in overcoming challenges and achieving shared goals, enhancing my inclusive and collaborative leadership style. </justify>

<justify> After completing my term as a Vice President, I went through a bit of a slump due to concern of career path. In that moment, I needed to find a source of power to overcome. For this reason, I climbed Hallasan, the highest mountain in South Korea, once a week for a while. As I made my way to the top of the mountain, the cold and hunger I endured gave me a new appreciation for the value of not giving up!! I realized "I can try everything!!".

<h4> 🍀 Where there’s a will, there’s a way.  </h4>

<justify> I believe in the value of firsthand experience for informed decision-making, so I've always prioritized gaining practical experience in my career.These values have shaped me into a challenging person. So I may have more failures than others. Nevertheless, growth can be derived from even failed experiences. I'll try hard with motivation. </justify>
