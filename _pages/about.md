Hello! Welcom to my Page!   
Thank you for your visit !  
     
I am Subin !  
     
    
I'm a very active, creative, and constantly improving person.  
This personality helps me move forward !  
I have been doing a lot of activities while attending undergraduate, so finally, I got to know myself well.      
Let me introduce myself, LET'S GO~ !!!       
           
          
       
#### 1. <span style="color:red"> Leadership </span> 
I am **a highly dirven** person - capable of anything. I revitalize the team and plan for each step.
S
#### 2. <span style="color:yellowgreen"> Sociability </span> 


#### 3. <span style="color:blueviolet"> Creativity and Adaptability</span> 
Sometimes, or often, knowledge supports productivity.  
Since I have 3 majors, I have the interdisciplinary power to fuse various fields freely. 


#### 4. <span style="color:orange"> Resilience</span> 
Have you ever heard about Resilience ?  
Actually, It is a psychology term which refers to the ability to recover and grow again in spite of adversity and hardships.
Everyone has a hard time. **The important thing is how to get out of that period and overcome it.**  

Once, I have an experience that the project was canceled on the way to wrapping up, as the partner ghosted EVERYONE !!
I was very desperate because there was nothing I could do for him. It makes me impotent.
Soon I also lost my will, and fell into a sense of loss. That was the start of **Burn-out**.   
  
When I found out that I had something psychological problems, I went on a trip straight away alone.  
And I thought a lot while traveling.
In that time, **I gave another meaning to the things that I had thought to have failed. (Redefining)**  
I did not think that It's just a waste of time, but I tried to think that it's a kind of learning and growth of time.

The reason why I suddenly went on a trip was that lots of my friends comforted me, but I thought I was the only one who could really console me.
So I needed time to face myself honestly, that's why I needed a new place.  
The result is..... It was working well, and I got back my Positive power.   

Plus honestly, Now I'm telling you, this is how I decided to be a researcher.  
( Before that, I wanted to be a politician like real congressman. and...The ghosted partner was my running mate for election.) 
I felt lost at that time, but now I've found my aptitude, and I'm on a roll now.  
  
**It is what Redefining is !! - the key way to overcome trauma.**  
Every failure has learning and growth, and I trust myself. 
  
This is the secret of how am i becoming **an tumbling doll-like person who can overcome anything well.**

# < Story about my triple majors ! >
   
## Q : What is the feature of each major ? 

<span style="background-color:#fff5b1"> **library and Information science** </span> is my first major at university.   
Even though it is not an engineering school, I attracted to thing thtat i can learn information technology such as programming.  



<span style="background-color:#fff5b1"> **Statistics** </span> makes me study easy.  
Basically, I learn research methodologies, furthermore, I learn many statistical techniques.  
That's why It is highly connected to other disciplines, like LIS and PSY.  
For example, information search used in LIS is the application of supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
