◾ **Library and Information Science**    
As a first discipline, this is how I got into information technology. In particular, I am interested in **Digital Curation** and **Computational Social Science**.   

◾ **Psychology**   
It started as a way to help a student government partner who was depressed. I currently use it to **analyze behavioral and Physiological data.**      

◾ **Statistics**  
It will help me design the research. Plus, I can use **Big-data** analytics and **Machine Learning** method.     

◾ **Data Curation**  
It is a specialized career within informatics. It's about **gathering** the data what I need, **storytelling** it, and putting it into meaningful **visualizations**.

## <center> 🖋 Study Area </center>

<br>
My interests have been broad and varied.With experience, I hope to narrow my interests to areas that I find more interesting.       

▶ **Computational Social Science**   

<div class="notice--gray">
  Within psychology, I am interested in social psychology, and I find it engaging to study the interactions between individuals and communities in various social situations. In most of study, the way to research social psychology begins with surveys. Of course, surveys allow me to identify independent variables more directly that affect the dependent variable, but they don't allow for exploratory analysis(EDA) and don't allow for getting large volumes of data. I want to leverage the information technology that I have and approach it by utilizing a variety of data.

# <center> Experience <center> 
<br>

I had a lot of diverse experiences in university, each of which led me to my current career path.

   <h3>Student Government vice-president</h3>
   <u> My deep love for the major, Library and information science, came from being a part of the student government. </u> Because I had a sense of belonging. 
   And to be able to explain the department to high school students visiting the college at the fair, I needed to know it well. As I was describing the direction of LIS and the fields it covers, I was naturally intrigued. In addition, this experience gave me the opportunity to communicate with a wide range of people. Especially, I spent a lot of time with my campaign partner. One day, my partner complained of psychological distress under the pressure. I wanted to help him, so I looked up various psychology books, and <u> that's how I got interested in psychology. </u>

  <h3>Digital Mental Health Service</h3>
  When I was worried about my partner's mental health issues, I was concerned about the stigmatization of accessing psychological services in Korea. That's why I thought a digital service where people can chat with an AI chatbot to solve mild mental problems would be nice. So, I interned at a startup company that provides digital mental health services, and at the same time, I conducted a meta-analysis of words with a psychological scale for emotion words. <u> Thus, I am passionate about using sentiment analysis in natural language processing to assess the emotional level of text.</u>

  <h3> Visiting thethe U.S. Library</h3>
  My full-fledged interests in library began when I traveled to United states Libraries. I have visited lots of public libraries in Los Angeles, including the LA Central Library, and some university libraries like UCLA or Standford. In particular, the university libraries in US gave me a fresh shock. Compared to Korean students, American seemed to regard the library as a real source of knowledge and an active space. Especially, in the case of the UNLV library, I experienced the library as a user rather than a visitor. I was free to discuss with my team members at open spaces in the library and even allowed to eat a drink or snack. For this reason, I am interested in the US library system and culture, wondering what makes such a big difference between the library culture in Korea and America.

<h4> 🤝 Many hands make light work. </h4>

</figure>

<justify> Last 4 years, I participated in at least 20 team activities. This has allowed me to meet a lot of different people. Some people are very motivated, but others don't want to spend a lot of time on team activities. Some people are very meticulous, while others are mistake-prone. It took a lot of experience and reflection for me to embrace this diversity. Therefore, I feel that the qualities needed as a leader are not to try to change them, but to show them how to work with their personality and personal circumstances. The important thing is to get them involved, so the team doesn't lose out. When I get a diverse group of people involved, it takes time to put the pieces together at first, but it can lead to creative and convergent thinking. Driving engagement in any situation is what I consider  <span style='background-color:#ffdce0'>leadership</span>.</justify>

<h4> 🔥  No pain No gain </h4>

<justify> "Nothing in this world is free". My dad used to say. What is easily gained is easy to lost, but what is hard gained is not easily lost. This is what I often think about when I'm going through a tough moment.

<h4> 🍀 Where there’s a will, there’s a way.  </h4>

역경과 회복탄력성 
도전과 추진력 그리고 실행력, 다양한 문화에 대한 탐험 궁금증 


<justify> 활동적인 성격 추진력있고 셀프 모티베이션이 활발한 스타일이라는 것을 돌려서 표현하기
( 취미 등산이나, 스피닝 등을 이용하여 )하고 싶은 것이 있으면 끝까지 실행하려는 끈기가 있다. 한 한기에 공모전을 쉬지 않고, 4번 출전했는데 이때 4달간 하루에 3시간~4시간 가량만 휴식하면서도 버틸 수 있는 체력과 정신력이 있다..뭐 대충 이런식으로. </justify>
