With this interdisciplinary background, I stand at the intersection of the humanities and technology (information systems). Over the next five years, I anticipate that rapid technological advances will widen disparities‚Äînot only in access to information but in everyday life‚Äîdriven by uneven AI literacy and technical skills. In this context, the shaping of information systems will become even more consequential. I therefore aim to investigate information behavior as foundation for shaping these systems responsibly. Methodologically, I will employ computational approaches‚Äîincluding NLP/ML analyses and experiment designs‚Äîand, where appropriate, integrate them with qualitative methods. My goal is to help move beyond a paradigm in which users must search for information, toward systems that proactively and interactively deliver trustworthy information to people when and where it is needed.

‚ñ∂ **Information Behavior**

- Information behavior <br>
(search as learning, Information seeking, Information encountering, and etc.)

‚ñ∂ **Human-AI interaction**  

- Generative AI 
- Future Information systems / Libraries with AI

# <center> Experience <center> 
<br>
I had a lot of diverse experiences over the years, each of which led me to my current career path.

   <h3>Vice-president of student council</h3>
   <justify>       
    My deep love for the major, Library and information science, came from being a part of the student government.  </justify>

  <h3>Internship</h3>
  <justify> I worked as a business intern at Trost, a startup offering digital mental health services. <u>There, I identified a critical need: people living with mental illnesses often face significant challenges in seeking and interpreting information.</u> Recognizing these challenges, I became passionate about designing accessible information systems for those struggling with low literacy.</justify>

  <h3> Awards in Data Utilization Contest</h3>
   After learning data analysis through statistics, I participated in 6 competitions, winning awards in 3 of them. My involvement in real-world projects has sharpened <u>my skills in applying machine learning, natural language processing, and big data processing techniques to extract bright insights from raw data.</u> I plan to continue leveraging these technical skills in my future research.

  <h3> Visiting the U.S. Libraries</h3>
  <justify> During my visit to the U.S. under my school's 'Global Expedition' program, I explored various libraries. This experience revealed the community support role of American libraries, contrasting with Korea's study-focused libraries. This inspired me to transform Korean libraries by adopting the inclusive, community-engaged approach. My goal is to study user-centric systems for diverse audiences. </justify>

</figure>

<justify> Over the last 2 years, participating in 20+ team activities has reinforced this for me. Embracing diverse viewpoints and leveraging each member's unique skills, I‚Äôve learned the power of collective effort in overcoming challenges and achieving shared goals, enhancing my inclusive and collaborative leadership style. </justify>

<h4> üî•  No pain No gain </h4>

<justify> After completing my term as a Vice President, I went through a bit of a slump due to concerns about my career path. At that moment, I needed to find a source of power to overcome. For this reason, I climbed Hallasan, the highest mountain in South Korea, once a week for a while. As I made my way to the top of the mountain, the cold and hunger I endured gave me a new appreciation for the value of not giving up!! I realized "I can try everything!".

<h4> üçÄ Where there‚Äôs a will, there‚Äôs a way.  </h4>

<justify> I believe in the value of firsthand experience for informed decision-making, so I've always prioritized gaining practical experience in my career. These values have shaped me into a go-getter person. So I may have more failures than others. Nevertheless, growth can be derived from even failed experiences. I'll continue to try hard with motivation. </justify>
