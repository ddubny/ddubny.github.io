This project is created for school project in course, Data Driven Society supervised by J.W.Yoon, Library and Information Science, JBNU.   

This project is focused on the social use and the visualization of data.   

I was the team leader of this project, and our team members including me are from the student government.   
When I was a vice-president in my department, I've often heard complaints about the commute environment.   
Accordingly, Memories of that time led us to choose this topic !!

Our main message is <span style='background-color:#ffdce0'>"please increase the quality of life for commuters by improving their commuting experience." </span>   

## Background of Research   
There were **3 Backgrounds** that led us to this message.

First of all, we showed the students' complains about the commute environment throgh the qualitative survey we received in advance.  

< Students said !! >  
- Difficult to get home at night due to <u>early last train times.</u>
- There is no subway, so we <u>need more buses.</u> 
- <u>The lack of direct routes</u> is inconvenient
- <u>Too many people</u> and not enough buses during commute hours.

This is something that often comes up as a student government pledge, but we've seen very little improvement.

Many students take the city bus. Almost 25% of students use buses to get to school !!  

## Take a survey with commuters.

**< The questionnaire configurations >**

1. Satisfaction with dispatch times by time

2. satisfaction of Last Bus time depending on the region of residence. 

3. Satisfaction of services in bus.

*We surveyed students who commute to school using city buses over a six-day period from May 24 to 29, 2023.*

As a result, 36 people responded to the survey, and 24 of whom were students who had used city buses for commuting.
