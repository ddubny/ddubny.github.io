In this project, We focused on <strong>the social use and the visualization of data.</strong>
I was the team leader of this project, and our team members including me are from the student government.
When I was a vice-president in my department, I've often heard complaints about the commute environment.
Accordingly, Memories of that time led us to choose this topic !! </justify>

First of all, we showed the students' complains about the commute environment throgh the qualitative survey we received in advance.  

< Students said !! >  
- Difficult to get home at night due to <u>early last train times.</u>
- There is no subway, so we <u>need more buses.</u> 
- <u>The lack of direct routes</u> is inconvenient
- <u>Too many people</u> and not enough buses during commute hours.

This is something that often comes up as a student government pledge, but we've seen very little improvement.
