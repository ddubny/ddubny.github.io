  say-hello: Hello, I'm <strong>Subin Seo.</strong>
  bio: I am an MLIS(Master of Library and Information Science) student at the University of Maryland, College Park. My research interests focus on <b>search</b> with a focus on <r>information behavior</r>, and more recently, I have been particularly interested in how information systems interact with humans. This has also led to a growing interest in <b>human–AI interaction</b>.
